	More than one solution is preserved (best 5 according to
	five measuring values).
	Player info files are changed again, now they are *.SokoInfo.

v 1.68: Bug fix in Ctrl-L (man is not displayed in interm positions).
	Bug fix - incorrect calculation of shelding steps in some of
	the saved solutions (thanks to Ming for reported bug).

v 1.69: Better output in a clipboard for Ctrl-L. Collection button and
	combo box are moved after level (now level is at leftmost position -
	more convenient after resizing of a dialog).

v 1.70: A small bugfix. Pressing ctrl, shift or ctrl-shift will not increase
	animation speed anymore. Only replay speed will be affected.

v 1.71: Bug fix. Negative values displayed when there are more than
	32768 moves or Pushes. Thanks to Marek Letrab for the bug report.

v 1.72: Bug fix in path finding using go through.

v 1.73: Small enhancement. Now program will keep relative path (if possible)
        to selected files (collection, skins, and player). I implement this
        because I put program on USB drive and find out that sometimes this
        USB drive is mounted on a different drive letter, so I have to change
        options.

v 1.74: Bug fix (bug introduced in ver 1.73). Now it is possible to open a
        collection which is in a folder inside folder which contains exe.

v 1.78: Added: Configurable size text shown in titlebar (requested by Ming).
        Now %r - rows & %c - cols could be used to select how level size
        should be shown, by default it is [ROWxCOL]

v 1.79: New option introduced: Solution should have at least one push.
        If on (by default) program will require at least one push to be
        performed to consider level as solved (there are some levels
        which are initially in solved state).

v 1.80: Improvement of grid size calculations.
        Selecting already selected ball will deselect it.

v 1.81: Most option values are saved in .SokoInfo file (not in registry)

v 1.82: Bug fix (thanks to Ming for the bug report). Incorrect read of levels
        (could even hangup) if levels has a MAC format text file (CR only).
v 1.83: Corrected Ctrl-L. Now it gives level as it is in collection file,
        before level is in normalized form.

v 1.84: Bug fix - some problems with levels more than 128 cols or rows
        Added - export of levels to text file & import a text file with solutions

v 1.85: Improved Instant Move performance. Only large levels with HUGE
        (more than 200000 moves) solutions are affected.
        Bug fixed - now YSokoban will correclty preserve HUGE solutions
        (more than 200000 moves).
        Add new option - not to save solution for levels with only 1 box.

v 1.86: Bug fixed (thanks to Ming) in "Instant Move" screen refresh
        (it seems like some boxes dissapear).

v 1.87: Bug fixed (thanks to Ming) in "Instant Move" screen refresh when
        show dircection change is off (it seems like some boxes dissapear).

v 1.88: Few bugs fixed (thanks to Ming). Some flicking removed.
        Correct behaviour when selecting unexisting collection from drop down list.
        Go to next level on left click (always) when level is finished.

v 1.89: Support for RLE packed levels and solutions. You can paste such
        levels/solutions.
        Ctrl-Shift-L will copy to clipboard packed level and solution.

v 1.90: Change in RLE packing support. There is an option how to encode space
        in RLE packed levels - with underscore '_' or with hyphen '-'.

v 1.91: Default value to encode space is set to hyphen '-' (for RLE).
        Problem fix - clicking on wall crashes version 1.90.
        The problem dissapear after recompilation and relink,
        so it is was not a bug but some other kind of a problem.

v 1.92: Bug fix (thanks to Ming) when pasting leves RLE rules are not applied
        anymore to other level attributes (like Title, Author and so on).

v 1.93: Bug fix (thanks to Ming) now selection of first collection in combo box is OK.
        Noramlly it sokoban does not change it becuse it is the current one, but
        if there is a level pasted then it should be selected.

v 1.94: Replace all '>' with ' ' when pasting level. The idea is to skip all '>'
        characters which are inserted in reply emails (at the begining of a line).
        Thanks to Ming for the requested feature.

v 1.95: Replace all ' ' with '_' or '-' when copying level to clipboard if 'alt'
        is pressed together with Ctrl-L. Which one (_ or -) will be used depends
        on RLE packing level option. Thanks to Ming for the requested feature.

v 1.96: Export of a solutions for current collection.

v 1.97: Copy rest of solution to clipboard (ctrl-alt-C or ctrl-alt-Ins),
        requested by Ming. Please see readme for explanation.

v 1.98: Bug fix. Importing solutions work even with levels which has more balls
        than targets or more targets than balls. In that case level is considered
        solved if there are no empty targets or no balls outside targets
        (depending on what is less: balls or targets).

v 1.99: Bug fix (thanks to Ming). Importing solutions now works even
        when solution is not in correct case.

v 1.102: Bug fix (thanks to Ming). Some problems with finding path with go-through
         (hint shows that moving is possible but does not do it actually).

v 1.103: Few cosmetic changes. Added warning message if attempt to
               save partial solution (because of possible internal error).

v 1.104: Changes requested by Ming:
               Added option not to save solution for incorrect levels (number of boxes != number of targets).
               Added hot key ctrl-alt-left/right arrow which jumps to prev/next incorrect level

v 1.105: Bug fix: import does not work.
         Improvement: import will import solutions which does not start with "Solution:",
         but they still should be one line.

v 1.106: "Stay on top" implemented

v 1.107: Support for hash code

v 1.114: Export solutions one level per file. Specify % (replaced by level number) in filename.

v 1.115: Bugfix in 1.114 + enhancement % will split to many files
         (containgin both level and solution), %% to many xsb and xht files.

v 1.116: A minor problem fixed (thanks to Ming). Do not make a strict check when
         importing level solutions (process them case insensitive).

v 1.117: Trivial levels (those without boxes to move in normalized form) are considered solved during export. Requested by Ming.

v 1.118: Solutions for trivial levels are also exported. It is possible to use F2 with trivial levels. Requested by Ming.
v 1.119: Trivial levels are not exported as not solved levels.
v 1.120: Bugfix finding solution for trivial level (level identified as trivial, but solution was wrong).
v 1.121: Bugfix: no crash anymore when importing invalid solution file.
v 1.122: Bugfix: stupid bug introduced in version 121 showing all levels as trivial.

v 1.125: added: 2 more slots for skins; show pushable is enhanced, now one can select pushable box by clicking on it with same mouse button (saves one mouse click); added mouse action "show pushable (always but man)" which will show places where man can go if clicked on it (otherwise it works like "show pushable").
v 1.126: fixed bugs introduced in 1.125
v 1.127: Playing solution can be paused with space and run again witch ctrl-space
v 1.128: Scrollbars in playing area.
v 1.129: Pressing left & right mouse buttons (or left button with shift) will act as select/move regardless of configuration.

v 1.204: ctrl-m will not put info for file, author, start line ... (this info is not needed in MF-8)
v 1.205: Bugfix. Now title is recalculated after every transformation (rotations are important), so that %r and %c are correctly displayed.
v 1.206: Bugfix. If you have two solutions and replay the second one with F2, it will not auto switch anymore to the first one at the end.
v 1.207: Bugfix. It seems that there were some other cases where selected solution is changed unexpectedly.

v 1.219: Fixed bug in go-through algorithm, thanks to Ming.
v 1.220: Remove '\' from pasted solution. Requested by Ming.

v 1.321: Improved solution manager. Now one can specify the number of solutions which YSokoban should keep. This version will automatically convert .sokoInfo file to a new format and it will not be readable anymore by the old version (so please make a copy of your .sokoInfo files).
v 1.322: Bugfix. "Best solution" indicator (letters PMICS for Push Move Inline Change Steps) are inccorect (namely I&C were swapped).
v 1.323: Write solution of trivial levels to exported solutions and to clipboard (Ctrl-L).
v 1.324: Bugfix: wrong display of pushes/moves for some solutions.

v 1.333: Added dragdrop collection/skin to YSokoban. Requested by Ming.
v 1.334: Added support for submitting solution for MF8 competition. Use Ctrl-Alt-F11 or Ctrl-Shift-F11 there should be SubmitSolution.url file in YSokoban folder. Requested by Chao Yang.
v 1.335: Small modification for submit solution: config filename is SubmitSolution.cfg (instead of .url, because windows completly hides extension, .url is still accepted).
v 1.336: Change in a way "File Selection Dialog" selects default folder - now it uses folder of last collection. Requested by Ming.
v 1.337: Better handling of level edit box when entering level manually.
v 1.338: Bugfix: Crashes sometimes in export level solutions when keeping more than one solutin. Thanks to Ming for bug report.

v 1.345: Removed restriction for replay solution by steps (ctrl-shift-V) now works for all solutions (there was 25000 limit for historical reasons).
v 1.346: Ctrl-I will paste moves instantly (without visualization). Requested by Ming.
v 1.347: Correct handling of edit box with level number even if there are marked levels (with ctrl-number). Thanks to Ming.

         Implemented "undo" in macro, use ~
         Implmeneted push man position in macro. '+' - push, '@' - pop and goto pushed position, '#' - pop (and stay).
         Change macro start on macro list. Left double click - run macro (was right click), Right click - run macro with * repeat counter.
         Added support for strict check in macro, use &amp; instead of * for strict checks.
         Added support for push/pull man position with relative offsets. Use [x,y] to add relative offsets (for example: +[1,2] will push current pos with relative offset, @[2, 3] will pop position and will add relative offset)
         Silently skip 1 or 2 lines of * or # (it happens that there are such lines in some collections)
         Use first appearance of Title/Author in a collection (not the last as it was up to now)
